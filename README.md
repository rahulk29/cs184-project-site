## Enabling Github Pages

To enable Github pages, go to the 'Settings' tab then click on 'Pages'. Under 'Build and Deployment' -> 'Branch', make sure that the branch is set to 'master' and the folder is set to 'root'. If these settings are correct, you should see a message saying "Your site is live at [website url]" at the top of the 'Pages' page, and navigating to the github page link should render index.html.
